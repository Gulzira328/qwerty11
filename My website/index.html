            What is Kdrama?

          <p>
            K-drama is short for “Korean drama” which pertains to television series created in South Korea.
            These series have become popular not only in Korea but globally, making them more accessible
            for K-drama fans through streaming websites like Netflix.Along with other Korean entertainment,
            such as K-pop and Korean movies,Kdramas have fueled the Korean Wave,
            which has been constantly expanding worldwide.</p>

          <h3>The History of Korean drama</h3>
          <p>
            The roots of television in South Korea go back to the mid-1950s, with the first Korean TV series
            broadcasting in 1962.
            It was broadcasted on KBS, Korean Broadcasting System, which has continued to exist as Korea’s big national
            channel.
            However, it wasn’t until the 1970s that Korean households properly began buying television sets. Most South
            Korean
            television series depicted historical times and historical figures only reached a small audience.
            After the surge of TVs in Korean homes, more diverse South Korean dramas began getting made, from
            national heroes such as King Sejong to tales of regular present-day people, especially their struggles and
            sufferings.</p>

      <p>Only the first four episodes of K-dramas will be shot before starting a broadcast. Otherwise, each drama is
        shot as close to the release date as possible to save on production expenses.
        Scripts aren’t entirely finalized, and changes to them may be made based on viewer feedback during the course
        of a K-drama. These changes may come at just a few hours’ notice before filming. There have even been
        instances where scenes of the episode are still being filmed as it is being shown on TV! So filming a drama in
        South Korea is most certainly an intense process.
